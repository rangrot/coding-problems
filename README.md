## Coding problems

This repository contains:

- Various coding problems and puzzles with their solutions.
- Common data structure implementations that I use.
- Embedded systems specific data problems and solutions.

Each problem has a README.md file, which outlines the problem statement, solution used, Space Time complexities, examples, test cases etc.

*Note:* I will keep adding to this list as things progress, this will probably have links to exact problems present in the repository.

Language Used: C99

Compiler: GCC using code blocks
