## Coding problems

This repo contains:

- Various coding problems and puzzels with their solutions.
- Common data structure implmentaions that I use.
- Embedded systems specific data problems and solutions.

Each problem has a README.md file, which outlines the problem statement, solution used, Space Time complexities, examples, test cases etc.

*Note:* I will keep adding to this list as things progress, this will probably have links to exact problems present in the repo.

Language Used: C11 (unless otherwise specified in the README file of the problem)

Compiler: GCC
