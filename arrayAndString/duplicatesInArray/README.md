# Question 1: Find if the array has duplicates - solve using sorting and hash map
# Question 2: Given an array of integers and a val x, find a pair of integers that sums up to x. - solve using sorting and hash map



# Given an array of numbers, replace each even number with two of the same number. e.g, [1,2,5,6,8] -> [1,2,2,5,6,6,8,8]. Assume that the array has enough space to accommodate the result. - Solve using reverse array traversal

# Given a sentence, reverse the words of the sentence. For example, "i live in a house" becomes "house a in live i". - Solve using reverse array traversal

  #  How to iterate through a 2D array? What about 3D array?
  #  How long does it take to resize an array?
  #  How to implement a resizeable array?
  #  How are 2D arrays represented in memory?

# Given an array of integers, find the continuous subarray, which when sorted, results in the entire array being sorted. For example: A = [0,2,5,3,1,8,6,9], result is the subarray [2,5,3,1,8,6] 

# Reverse the order of elements in an array. For example, A = [1,2,3,4,5,6], Output = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

# Two Sum Problem - Find 2 numbers in a sorted array that sum to X. For example, if A = [1,2,3,4,5] and X = 9, the numbers are 4 and 5
